## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my graduation project (PFE) focused on Sentiment Classification using NLP. I'm also developing two mobile apps using Flutter â€” one for my internship and another for a tech competition.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter & Dart, and improving my skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and mobile UI/UX design.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI-powered apps, mobile solutions, and anything that blends creativity with technology.
